## Inventory Monitoring & SDD Workflow Implementation

### Summary
Successfully transformed the app into a stateful Inventory Management System and established a strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow.

### Achievements
- **Inventory Logic**: Added `inventory` table and auto-sync from `entries`.
- **UI Enhancements**: 
    - Stock badges (In Stock/Out of Stock) on dashboard.
    - Status toggle functionality with optimistic updates.
    - **Timeline Modal**: Chronological price and stock history for specific items.
- **Workflow Governance**: 
    - Integrated "Skill Discovery" and "Spec Check" into `start-task`.
    - Hardened `finish-task` with SDD verification.
    - 100% Mocked unit tests for DB operations.
    - Fixed hanging test processes via refined CLI flags.

### Technical Notes
- **Migrations**: New `inventory` table added. Manual migration script used as fallback for `drizzle-kit push` issues.
- **Portals**: Uses React Portals for accessible modal rendering.
- **Testing**: 15 unit tests and 15 smoke tests pass.

### Next Steps
1. **[SEV2] Data Portability**: CSV Export in Settings.
2. **[SEV2] Inventory Alerts**: Push notifications for low stock.
3. **[SEV3] PWA Polish**: Offline sync consistency audit.
